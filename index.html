                <p  class="main">I always love to collect minimal and modern furniture for my home and specially for my work place. Due to covid situation as I need to work from home so now a days it’s mandatory for me to think more creatively within my work place. so, minimal colored furniture will help me a lot in this case.</p>
             <h3>Needs</h3>
                <p  class="main">Current app UI is messy. I think need to improve the app user interface. So that all information can be found organized and easy to navigate. Also need to show the order process in a modern way.</p>
            <h3>Pain Points</h3>
            <ul>
                <li  class="main">Can’t find the size of the product directly from the app user interface.</li>
                <li  class="main">I can’t track my order properly.</li>
                <li  class="main">There is no option to make a report for the product issue.</li>
                <li  class="main">I can’t find the return option from the app user
                    interface.</li>
                <li  class="main">Current app interface is really hard to navigate and browse as all informations are not 
                    organized here.</li>
